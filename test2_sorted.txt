While longtime fans will remember Combat Evolved as the birth of the series, newer players should note that Anniversary picks up the story right where Reach left off.While the story remains nearly untouched, keen-eyed players will note the addition of some new story content through several scattered terminals.Ten years ago, Halo single-handedly managed to make gamers sit up and pay attention to the fledgling Xbox.Master Chief awakes from cryo-sleep as a Covenant armada descends on the ship from which he escaped Reach.The armored hero and his shipmates crash land on a mysterious ring world and begin to unravel its secrets.Each triggers a cinematic that expands on the Halo fiction in new ways, offering untold details about the Flood, the Forerunners, and other story points.The revamped anniversary edition of the game does an excellent job of honoring that legacy, even if the project as a whole feels like it’s seeking an identity in the middle ground between new and old.Redefining the potential scope and ambition of a console FPS, Bungie’s original game established a benchmark for control, pacing, universe-building, and multiplayer options that would be emulated for years.
