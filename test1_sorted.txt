The survey was the latest of many showing that Americans are dangerously unprepared for retirement.One-quarter of middle-class Americans fear they will have to work until they're at least 80 years old to afford a comfortable retirement (if "retirement" is even the right word, given that many of these people may never actually retire).That conclusion, in a survey released Wednesday by Wells Fargo & Co., found that nearly three-quarters of Americans expect to continue working into what long has been retirement age.Or perhaps even 75.Or 65.The average person has squirreled away a mere 7% of their hoped-for retirement savings -- a median of just $25,000 versus a desired goal of $350,000, according to the survey.A little more than half of those said they'll need to work to pay their bills, while the rest said they want to keep working.Three in 10 people in their 60s have less than $25,000, suggesting they'll have no choice but to live on Social Security.With only limited savings, many people are realizing they must work much longer, must dramatically scale back their lifestyles, or both.Forget about retiring at age 55.
